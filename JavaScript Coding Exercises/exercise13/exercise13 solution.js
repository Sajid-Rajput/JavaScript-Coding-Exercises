// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as â€œI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.

let vehicles = ["Duccati", "Tesla", "Honda"];

console.log(`I would like to own a ${vehicles[0]} motorcycle`);
console.log(`I would like to own a "${vehicles[1]} Model X" car`);
console.log(`I would like to own a "${vehicles[2]} Accord" car`);
